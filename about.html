<p>My name is Lauren Kwan, I am a rising high school senior in the NYC metropolitan area.  After attending the Girls Who Code Immersion summer program in 2019, I became very interested in technology and initiated the Girls Who Code Club at my school.  I am a strong believer that we are in this world to help and support others.  Mostly this support starts within our families and communities.  As such I have created this website after caring for my
demented Grandmother (Abuelita). For 3 years I was one of my grandmothers caregivers. I cared for my grandmother for 2 hours everyday after school; from the time her home aid left until the time my mom would come home from work.  This experience has shed light on caring for a loved one with this disheartening disease and has encouraged me to share what I learned this experience.
