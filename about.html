<p>My name is Lauren Kwan. I am a rising high school senior in the NYC metropolitan area. After attending the Girls Who Code Immersion summer program in 2019, I became very interested in technology and initiated the Girls Who Code Club at my school.  I am a strong believer that we are in this world to help and support others.  Mostly this support starts within our families and communities.
  As such, I have created this website after caring for my Grandmother "Abuelita" who had dementia.
  For three years, I was one of my grandmother's caregivers. I cared for my grandmother
  for two hours everyday after school, from the time her home aid left until the time my mom would come home from work.
  This experience has educated me on caring for a loved one with this disheartening disease and has encouraged me to
  share what I have learned.
