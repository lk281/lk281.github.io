      <h1 class="title"> What To Do When a Loved One With Dementia Gets Angry</h1>
      <p>I learned in caring for my grandmother that dementia causes fear and confusion.</p>
      <p>In the beginning my grandmother would say things that were not right and I would contradict her and correct her.  This would cause her to get frustrated, upset and angry.
      </p>
      <p>I quickly learned this was not the correct approach as I was not helping her but getting her more frustrated and anxious.</p>
      <p>When a loved one with dementia demonstrates anger and confusion is important not to contract and to provide a level of comfort.  </p>
      <p>I would gently hold my grandmother hand and talk to her.  Later on I discovered playing her favorite songs were soothing and also made her happy and led her to move and dance even in sitting position.</p>
      <p>Although it may be sad to see a loved on with dementia deteriorate, it brought me comfort to bring her comfort and joy, hence the focus should be the loved one and bringing them comfort and joy.</p>
