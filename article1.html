      <h1 class="title"> What To Do When a Loved One With Dementia Gets Angry</h1>
      <img class="angry" src="images/angry.gif">
    <div class="content">
      <p >I learned in caring for my grandmother that dementia causes fear and confusion.</p>
      <p>In the beginning, my grandmother would say things that were not right and
        I would correct her. This would cause her to get frustrated, upset and angry.
      </p>
      <p>I quickly learned this was not the correct approach as I was not helping her but getting her more frustrated and anxious.</p>
      <p>When a loved one with dementia demonstrates anger and confusion, it is important to not contradict and
        to provide a level of comfort. </p>
      <p>I would gently hold my grandmother's hand and talk to her. Later on, I discovered playing that her favorite songs were soothing to her and also made her happy. This led her to move and tap her feet in sitting position.</p>
      <p>Although it may be sad to see a loved on with dementia deteriorate, it brought me comfort to bring her joy.</p>
